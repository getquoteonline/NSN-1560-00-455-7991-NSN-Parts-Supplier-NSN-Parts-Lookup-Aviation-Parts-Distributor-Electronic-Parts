## 10. Why It Matters

Though seemingly minor, ducts like this are essential for:

- Regulating environmental conditions  
- Ensuring system cooling and bleed-air routing  
- Maintaining pilot comfort and avionics performance

A flawed auxiliary duct can reduce system efficiency or introduce air leaks—impacting safety.
